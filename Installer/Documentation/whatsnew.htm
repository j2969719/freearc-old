<h1>What's new in FreeArc 0.666</h1>

<p>New FreeArc version made break-through in compression efficiency!
It is 1.5-2x faster than previous speed king - FreeArc 0.60.
And 2-5x faster than best other compression programs (7-zip, WinRAR, WinZIP)
for the same comrpession ratio. New FreeArc is as fast as hell - it's why we chosen
